# GSoC 2021 Progress Tracking

## Week 1 (8<sup>th</sup> - 12<sup>th</sup> June 2021)

### What did you do this week?
* Created sub-dataset based on the paper
* Trained first model based on parameters provided in the paper
* Testing scripts to visualize and evaluate model performance. 
### What do you plan to do for next week?
* Model accuracy does not match what is reported. Finetuning of the model will be required over the coming weeks
* Test other existing implementations to check outputs. 
### Are you blocked on anything?
* No

## Week 2 (14<sup>th</sup> - 18<sup>th</sup> June 2021)

### What did you do this week?
* Trained models with a variety of tweaks - Different activation function, different batch size, inverted axis
* Questions for the authors of the paper
* Begin working on app for data collection
### What do you plan to do for next week?
* Complete data collection app and collect some data
* Fix the model using inputs from the authors and mentors
### Are you blocked on anything?
* No

## Week 3 (21<sup>st</sup> - 25<sup>th</sup> June 2021)

### What did you do this week?
* Figured out multi GPU training with PyTorch Lightning

## Week 4 (28<sup>st</sup> June - 02<sup>nd</sup> July 2021)

### What did you do this week?
* Received inputs from authors and began incorporation of new methods
* Better results and testing framework created
* Setting up Neptune.ai for experiment tracking
* Began SVR coding for final step
### What do you plan to do for next week?
* Follow up questions for authors
* Additional documentation
* Further testing and fine tuning
### Are you blocked on anything?
* No

## Week 5 (05<sup>th</sup> - 09<sup>th</sup> July 2021)

### What did you do this week?
* SVR based personalization experiments started
* Set up comet.ml for tracking since Neptune.ai had issues
* Setting up Neptune.ai for experiment tracking
* Documentation
### What do you plan to do for next week?
* Learn a simple affine transform instead of the SVR
* Finish the SVR based personalization
* Collect data using the app and check if it works
### Are you blocked on anything?
* No
